Q. How do I estimate the CI for a SUCRA?

A. You should not estimate a CI for SUCRA! This is because SUCRA is not a parameter (like a treatment effect) but a summary of the evidence (like a p-value). 

This is discussed in https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895435617308016 - this commentary refrains from a definitive statement, "it is unclear whether it makes sense to report and interpret uncertainty intervals for SUCRA measures", but makes its views clear, "the interpretation of the SUCRA uncertainty intervals would be irrelevant".




Q. Why don't my results from pairwise MA agree with NMA?

A. In general, the answer is that NMA includes more evidence than pairwise MA, so you don't expect to get the same answers. 

However there are some cases where you might expect to get the same answer for a particular comparison, say B vs A:
1. if there is only direct evidence for B vs A.
2. if you run network sidesplit A B and compare the direct evidence with the pairwise MA result.

Whether you can expect the same answer depends on heterogeneity and the presence of multi-arm trials.
* If there are multi-arm trials involving A and B then these may contribute indirect evidence.
* Otherwise, if you run a common-effect NMA (i.e. using the fixed option of network meta or network sidesplit), then you should indeed get perfect agreement. 
* If you run a default random-effects NMA, then you won't get agreement. This is because these models assume the heterogeneity variance is the same for all comparisons, whereas when you do separate pairwise MAs you allow a different heterogeneity variance for each comparison.
* Finally if you run a random-effects NMA with the bscov(unstructured) option, then you should get agreement, since this allows a different heterogeneity variance for each comparison.
