PROBLEM IN NETWORK MAP - DISCOVERED AND RESOLVED
Ian White, 4 Sep 2019

Dear Statalisters,

I've discovered an error in my -network- suite for performing network meta-analysis.

If you have been using -network map- with a non-default choice of treatment then please read on.

network map labels the treatments wrongly if all of these are true:
- the reference treatment is not the first treatment (i.e. not the default)
- you have updated your version of -networkplot- to version 2.* (dated 9jan2018 or later)
- you did not use the -trtcodes- option, i.e. you displayed treatment names not treatment codes

To fix this, please download the latest version of the network suite (version 1.6.1 or later, dated 4sep2019 or later) from ...

I'm sorry to anyone who has been affected by this. I'd like to thank Ewelina Rogozinska for bringing this to my attention.
