Plan for network tutorial

1. Simple data set with AD, e.g. the thrombolytics data

Variants: 
	sparse data with no df for heterogeneity / inconsistency / both
	disconnected network

2. Starting from IPD via mvmeta_make (do we have all the tools?)


?? how do I report my results [from an advice email]

network meta shows comparisons only with placebo. This is probably more appropriate in a clinical area where none of the treatments are widely used.

network compare shows all comparisons. This is probably more appropriate where some of the treatments are widely used. 

Both the above report treatment contrasts in the metric you have chosen (e.g. OR or SMD). Network rank does something different: it reports the treatment ranks, and can be appropriate as a supplement to the treatment contrasts if your main focus is to identify one or several best treatments.

If you want to use GRADE, you could consider using the CINEMA tool, https://cinema.ispm.unibe.ch/.
